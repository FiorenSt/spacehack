    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases the potential of multimodal models like Gemini 1.5 Pro for tackling zero-shot object classification problems. We'll explore how this advanced model can analyze telescope images, compare them against reference and difference images, and classify them as \"real\" or \"bogus\" solely based on visual information and human-provided instructions. By the end of this notebook, you'll gain insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How Gemini 1.5 Pro can perform zero-shot classification tasks without explicit training.\n",
    "* The power of multimodal models to understand and reason about visual content.\n",
    "* Building effective prompts for complex image analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries and Build Functions:** We start by importing the necessary libraries for image loading, processing, and evaluation. We also define functions to facilitate the analysis and visualization of results.\n",
    "2. **Build System Instructions for the Prompt:** A well-crafted prompt is crucial for guiding Gemini 1.5 Pro towards the desired output. We carefully define instructions outlining the task, the type of images, and the desired classification outcome.\n",
    "3. **Load the Dataset:** We load a collection of telescope images, including reference, difference, and new images, to be used for the classification task.\n",
    "4. **Run Gemini 1.5 Pro with the Prompt:** We execute the prompt with Gemini 1.5 Pro, iterating over 100 samples from the dataset to get classifications for each image.\n",
    "5. **Evaluate Model Performance:** We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify \"real\" and \"bogus\" images. Finally, we visualize the results for better understanding."

    "PERSONA = [\"\"\"<PERSONA>\n",
    "You are an experienced astrophysicist and your task is to classify the given set of 4 images is real or bogus. You have seen thousands of images during your life time and you are very good at making this classification by look at the images and following the instructions. \n",
    "</PERSONA>\"\"\"]\n",
    "INSTRUCTIONS = [\"\"\"\\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n",
    "**1. Purpose**\n",
    "This is meant as a visual guide to vetting MeerLICHT/BlackGEM data for the Real/Bogus classification. At this stage we are trying to get a high-fidelity machine learning network of what is real and what is bogus. As such it is not necessary to further classify what type of real or what type of bogus it is. But what is real and what is bogus?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Real: Any source that is of astrophysical origin, and variable in time and/or position.**\n",
    "A real source therefore:\n",
    "a) has a shape that reflects a **point-source**. Most MeerLICHT data is taken in decent focus conditions, so for us it means that the source is **round**, and has a (visual) extent of ~5-10 pixels. Because conditions vary this number also varies, also between the new and the reference image.\n",
    "b) is **positive** in either the new or the reference image.\n",
    "c) can be **variable** in both directions, e.g. fading or brightening between the new and reference image, and is therefore positive or negative in the difference image \n",
    "d) can **(dis)appear** between the new and the reference image. This means that in one of the two images there is no source at all, and in the other there is a clear point-source. Note that this can happen on top of an underlying galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a transient and a variable?\n",
    "This is a long-standing and fluid debate. For the moment we will adopt the following distinction:\n",
    "a) a **transient** is an object **with no underlying quiescent point-source counterpart** in the reference image.\n",
    "b) a **variable** is an object with **an underlying quiescent point-source counterpart** in the reference image.\n",
    "This is a phenomenological distinction based solely on our own data, not an astrophysical distinction.\n",
    "E.g. we would all consider a supernova to be a transient (i.e. a destructive, non-repeating, once-offevent). However, in deep images it may have an underlying counterpart (the original star). Or it was detected while bright in the reference image and therefore all the new images shows it to be fading, i.e. a variable.\n",
    "On the other hand, we can have a dwarf nova outburst occuring in a Cataclysmic Variable with a counterpart that is below our detection limit. Eventhough astrophysically most people would classify a dwarf nova outburst as a variable (i.e. a non-destructive, repeating event), in our data it will look like a transient.\n",
    "Without any additional information (light curves, deeper images, spectra) we will not be able to make a distinction between these. However, for our real-bogus classification this doesn’t matter. Both are **real**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bogus: Any source that is not of astrophysical origin**\n",
    "Bogus sources are those that are not of astrophysical origin but artefacts, caused by the detector, cosmic-rays, reflections, or the data processing.\n",
    "A bogus source therefore generally has:\n",
    "a) a shape that is **not a point-source**: not round, not ‘Gaussian’, with a size ≾5 pixels or ≿10 pixels. Note that a ‘point’ (i.e. one bright pixel), is not a point-source.\n",
    "b) is **negative** in either the new or the reference image. Any real source needs to show a positive image, i.e. countrates higher than the background sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Information provided**\n",
    "All vetters will be shown three images that are cut-outs of the science images around the suspected source. Therefore it is important to note that **the candidate transient lies in the center of the cut-outs**. Use the full 100x100 pixel image to base your judgement on. If you see that the transient candidate has a very different psf than other stars in the image; or if the image is extended and very close to the edge (possibly a reflection): use this information in your judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three images are:\n",
    "1) The **new** image, i.e. the latest science image. This is fully reduced, i.e. debiased and flatfielded.\n",
    "2) The **reference** image, against which the new image is compared. For the moment the reference images are simply the first image that was taken of a field. The depth and image quality of the reference image therefore does not have to be better/deeper than that of the new image. \n",
    "3) The **difference** image. This is the image that is the residual after the new and reference image are  subtracted from each other after being sky-subtracted and scaled/convolved to have matching point- spread-functions. Variations in sky background and seeing should therefore not show up in the difference image. Reals should show up as a point-source object with either positive or negative flux. Residuals due to an imperfect astrometric regridding can still show up. These will generally be seen as ‘ying-yang’ patterns of positive/negative flux. \n",

Additionally, the lack of a clear source in the new and reference images makes it highly unlikely that this is a real transient or variable. Based on these observations, I classify this as Bogus. It is most likely just a random fluctuation in the background noise.</td>\n",

However, the difference image shows a negative 'yin-yang' pattern. This pattern in the difference image indicates that the subtraction process was not perfect likely due to a slight shift in the source's position between the two images. Such patterns are indicative of imperfect astrometric regridding, which is an artifact of data processing and not an astrophysical phenomenon. Therefore, I classify this source as Bogus.  \n",

This pattern is not consistent with the characteristics of a point source, which should be round and have a visual extent of approximately 5-10 pixels.

Furthermore, it exhibits a point-source like shape in both images, which is consistent with an astrophysical origin. In the difference image, there is a clear negative residual at the location of the candidate, suggesting that the source has become fainter in the new image compared to the reference image. Therefore, based on the provided information, I classify this candidate source as Real.  \n",
