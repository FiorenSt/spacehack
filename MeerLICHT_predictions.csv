This is likely a bogus source caused by a moving object or some other artifact.",No interest
535,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"This is very similar to Example 1. There is a linear artefact in both the New and Reference images which is likely due to a diffraction spike.

This can be confirmed by looking at the Difference image where a 'yin-yang' pattern is visible at the center. This indicates that the suspected transient is only the result of the images being misaligned.",No interest
2634,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The source in the New image is not circular and very small (<5 pixels). It appears to be a single bright pixel, which is likely a cosmic ray. No source at the same location (center of the cutout)  in the Reference image.

1403,5,Yes,Real,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images show a source at the center, with an additional bright source in the upper part of the image. In the Difference image, we can see a clear Yin-Yang pattern, which indicates that the suspected transient is likely due to misalignment. Despite the seemingly present source in the New and Reference images, the misalignment pattern in the Difference image confirms its classification as Bogus.",No interest
785,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New image presents a handful of bright pixels at the center, potentially resembling a cosmic ray. The Reference image also shows a similar group of pixels, but dimmer. While the Difference image exhibits a negative residual, the shape and nature of the pixels in the New and Reference images point towards a bogus classification. It's highly probable this is due to unflagged hot pixels present in both images.",No interest
589,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is a source visible just outside the red circle in the New image but not in the centre. It could be a cosmic ray, but it is too bright and extended. The Reference image does not show the same trail.  The Difference image shows a negative elongated feature. This is likely an artefact, such as a satellite or airplane, that was captured in the New image, leading to a bogus classification.",No interest
2702,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images present a source at the center of the cutout, however, it is blended with a diffraction spike from a nearby bright star, as visible in the upper left corner of the images. Even if a source is present, the strong presence of the diffraction spike makes it unreliable to be classified as Real. Moreover, the Difference image shows a ring pattern that is a clear sign of an artefact.",No interest
227,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is not a source at the center of the New image, only a piece of a diffraction spike from the bright star above it. In the Reference image, there appears to be a faint source at the center of the cutout, but this is also likely an artifact from the diffraction spike, as the spike looks much fainter in this image. The Difference image confirms that this is a bogus source, as it shows a negative elongated source.",No interest
152,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images show a streak of light, which is most likely a diffraction spike from a bright star just outside the field-of-view on the right. The spike crosses the center of the red circle, which doesn't contain a circular source. The Difference image shows a black circle around the location of the bright star just outside the cutouts, and a white streak corresponding to the diffraction spike. This is a bogus source.",No interest
377,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both New and Reference images present what looks like a diffraction spike from a bright star, as visible by the straight line crossing the images diagonally. The source at the center of the red circle in both images looks like an irregularity in the diffraction spike. The Difference image shows a residual positive source in the center that is likely only the difference between pixels in the two diffraction spikes. This suggests that the source is only a product of the diffraction spike and therefore bogus.",No interest
790,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images present a vertical line through the image, which is an artefact, likely related to the bright source at the edge of the image. The source at the center of the cutout seems to be present in both New and Reference images. However, since it is very faint and on top of an artefact it is impossible to say if it's real or not. In these cases, it is better to classify as Bogus. The Difference image further confirms this by showing a Yin-Yang residual.",No interest

806,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both New and Reference images present what seems like the same source: a bright, saturated object is visible in the right part of the image, and a trail propagates towards the left part, crossing the red circle. Because of this trail, the source is classified as Bogus. Indeed, a similar trail is visible in the Difference image, but this time with negative flux.",No interest
330,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images show a bright, saturated source at the edge of the image, indicating it's likely a very bright star. This star is causing a vertical diffraction spike, which is visible in both images. The Difference image shows a clear Yin-Yang pattern at the center, indicating that the subtraction isn't perfect due to the presence of the diffraction spike.",No interest
592,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"A diffused source is at the centre of the New image, aligned with the 45-degree diffraction spike of a bright source at the cutout corner. The Reference image also shows a similar diffraction spike and blob. The Difference image displays a positive blob, which is a bogus source caused by the diffraction spike. Diffraction spikes can sometimes appear with blobs or irregularities instead of straight lines.",No interest
2500,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There appears to be no source at the center of the New image. In the Reference image, there is a source at the center of the red circle. Looking closely, there are also diffraction spikes visible in the Reference image, that intersect at the center, making this a bogus source. The Difference image shows negative flux at the location of the suspected source, further supporting a bogus classification.",No interest
2184,5,Yes,Real,Real,"There is a faint source at the center of the New image, and a very similar one at the center of the Reference image. The Difference image shows residuals around the central source location, with both positive and negative values. This indicates that the source is variable. Although the difference image does not show a perfectly circular source, it is likely due to the source being very faint and close to the noise level.",Low interest
729,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New and Reference images show a diffraction spike from a bright star present outside the red circle. Although there is what appears to be a faint source in the New image, this is only a brighter pixel from the diffraction spike. The Difference image shows a negative elongated artefact. This example showcases how a diffraction spike can be identified even when the bright star that generated it is not in the cutout.",No interest
1079,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is a dark, almost circular source at the center of the New and Reference images, which is a strong indication of a bogus source. Real sources cannot appear negative in either New or Reference images. The negative feature in the New image creates a residual in the Difference image that could be mistaken for a possible transient, but the presence of this feature in both New and Reference images confirms its bogus nature.",No interest
733,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New image shows a faint source that seems to be located on top of a diffuse object. There is a bright source in the Reference image, and no clear signs of the diffuse object. This suggests that the source in the New image is the same as the one in the Reference, which saturated the detector in the latter. This is confirmed by looking at the Difference image, which shows a strong 'Yin-Yang' pattern.",No interest
664,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is a faint source in the New image at the center of the cutout. However, in the Reference image, no clear source can be seen at the center, but instead, it seems like there is a negative version of the source in the New image. This can also be seen in the Difference image, which shows a negative residual. Real sources cannot have a negative flux in the New or Reference image, so this source is bogus.",No interest
360,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images show a faint source at the center of the cutout. However, the Difference image shows a negative source, meaning that the source got fainter. A real source can fade, but it can never be negative in the New or Reference images, so this must be Bogus. It is plausible that there is a faint real source at this location, and an additional artefact in the New image makes the source appear even fainter.",No interest
626,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is a source at the center of both the New and Reference images, but it's unclear if the source is circular. Looking at the Difference image, the residual is negative, which means the source got dimmer or disappeared in the New image. However, it also shows a 'yin-yang' pattern, meaning the astrometry is not perfect and the New and Reference images are not perfectly aligned. This means that the source is classified as Bogus.",No interest
513,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New image shows a faint source, while the Reference image features a more intense, slightly elongated light source at the center. Additionally, the Difference image reveals a negative residual, implying a dimming. However, a closer look at the broader context of the Reference image indicates a cut in the data marked by a distinct line, with the potential source positioned along this boundary. This suggests a likely artifact within the data, making the source unreliable for classification as a real transient.",No interest
333,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New image shows a faint source at the center of the cutout. However, the Reference image shows a vertical line that cuts through the image and goes slightly outside of the red circle. Therefore, the source in the New image is aligned with that line. This suggests that the source in the New image is likely associated with the same artefact, and therefore it is bogus. The Difference image shows a negative elongated feature, confirming that we are dealing with an artefact present only in the Reference.",No interest
750,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and Reference images show a source at the center of the cutout, however, it is partially covered by a diffraction spike from a nearby bright star. The presence of both the source and the diffraction spike in both images suggests that this might be just a misalignment problem. The Difference image shows a strong negative source at the center, surrounded by positive residuals, consistent with a Yin-Yang pattern. Therefore, this source is bogus, caused by a misalignment between the New and Reference images.",No interest
1169,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New and Reference images both show a bright, saturated source, likely a star. The presence of a source in both images suggests it is not a transient event. Additionally, the Difference image reveals a clear 'yin-yang' pattern centered on the source. This pattern is indicative of imperfect astrometric registration or misalignment between the images. Therefore, the source is classified as Bogus due to the lack of true variability and the presence of a strong 'yin-yang' pattern in the Difference image.",No interest

The shape of the light source is the same in all three images, and it's not circular. It is likely an artefact of a moving object such as a satellite was captured in both images, or internal reflection.",No interest
2571,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Examining the New image, there is no obvious source but a collection of negative pixels that could be confused as a faint source. There is no source at the center of the Reference image. The Difference image displays a slightly elongated negative source, which is not a real astronomical object. The source is too sharp to be real, and the negative pixels in the New image indicate this is likely an artefact.",No interest
2923,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both New and Reference images show a source in the middle of a strong vertical line, which looks like a detector artefact. The source in the Reference image is saturated and bleeds into a vertical line, confirming it is not a real astronomical source. Although the Difference image shows a negative source as it would be expected from a disappeared source, we can confidently classify it as Bogus given the nature of the Reference image.",No interest
427,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"There is no obvious source at the center of the New image, although the presence of a diagonal diffraction spike suggests there might be a source just outside the cutout. Similarly, the Reference image shows a faint diagonal streak with a source at its center. The Difference image displays both the streak and a negative blob. As there's no clear source at the center of the New image, this is likely a bogus source.",No interest
209,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The shape of the source in the New image is not circular and it appears to be just a couple of bright pixels. Also, in the Reference image, there is no source at the center but a single black pixel, which most likely is a cosmic ray hit. Finally, the Difference image shows a negative elongated residual. This is most likely a hot pixel that has varied in brightness between the two epochs, creating a bogus detection.",No interest
403,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New and Reference images show a source on the left and a faint, small trail of pixels near the centre. In the Difference image, the left source is subtracted well (as expected, since it is not variable), but the trail of pixels in the center is present as a negative residual. This suggests it is likely an artefact, possibly due to a moving object like a satellite or airplane, making it a bogus source.",No interest
1014,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"Both the New and the Reference images show a diffraction spike from a bright star, which is located outside of the cutout, at the bottom right corner. The diffraction spike crosses the whole cutout, going from the bottom right corner to the top left one. Even if a faint source is present at the center of the New image, the Difference image shows it is part of the diffraction spike, as it presents residuals all along the spike.",No interest
905,5,No,Bogus,Real,"No source is present in the New image at the center of the cutout. The Reference image, however, shows a very bright pixel at the center, which is likely a cosmic ray. Because of this artefact in the Reference, the Difference image shows a negative source, but this is not indicative of a real transient. Note that in this case, the 'variability' is only due to an artefact present in the Reference image.",High interest
2746,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The new image shows a possible source at the center, but it's too small and faint to be considered a reliable detection. The reference image has no visible source at the central location. The difference image shows a very small and faint negative source. Given that the potential source is barely visible in the new image and absent in the reference image, it is highly likely that this is just noise or a very faint cosmic ray and not a real astrophysical transient.",No interest
391,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The source at the center of the New image is negative, which automatically excludes the possibility of it being real. In the Reference image, the source is positive, but it has the shape of a dipole. These two hints point toward a bogus source, which is confirmed by the Difference image: it shows a negative source, meaning that the source was brighter in the Reference. However, since it was negative in the New image, we can conclude that it is a bogus source.",No interest
3111,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The source is not present in the Reference image, which only shows a grey area from a bad pixel masking. This means that this part of the sky was not imaged properly in the past. The New image shows a potential source at the center; however, it is elongated and could either be an artefact from the telescope or the fact that the object moved during the exposure. Therefore, although the Difference image shows a positive residual, because of the bad Reference image and the elongated shape, I classify it as Bogus.",No interest
3025,5,Yes,Bogus,Bogus,"The New image shows a bright, slightly elongated source at the edge of what appears to be a masked region as it shows a different background noise with respect to the rest if the image. The Reference image does not show any source at the center, but the masked region is still present. The Difference image shows a clear positive residual. This is a bogus source due to an imperfect data reduction. When the images are subtracted from each other, any mismatch in the edges of masked regions can lead to spurious residuals, mimicking real sources.",No interest
