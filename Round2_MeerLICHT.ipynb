    "**1. Purpose**\n",
    "Help vet astronomical data for the Real/Bogus classification. The goal is for you to use your expertise to distinguish between real and bogus sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Information Provided**\n",
    "You will be shown three astronomical image cutouts:\n",
    "a) **New Image:** The newest image centered at the location of the suspected transient source. \n",
    "b) **Reference Image:** A reference image from the same telescope of the same part of the sky to be used for comparison. It shows if the source was already there in the past or not.\n",
    "c) **Difference Image:** The residual image after the new and reference images are subtracted. Real sources should appear in this cutout as circular objects with only positive (white pixels) or only negative (black pixels) flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Criteria for Classification**\n",
    "- **Real Source:** \n",
    "  - **Shape:** Circular shape at the center of the cutout with a visual extent of ~5-10 pixels, varying with focus conditions.\n",
    "  - **Brightness:** Positive flux (white pixels) in either the new or reference image. Positive or negative flux in the Difference image. \n",
    "  - **Variability:** The source at the center can fade or brighten between the new and reference images, appearing as positive or negative in the Difference image.\n",
    "  - **Presence:** The source may (dis)appear between the new and reference images. A source may also appear on top of an underlying source (e.g., supernova on a galaxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bogus Source:** \n",
    "  - **Shape:** Non-circular shape (e.g., elongated). This includes irregular shapes, positive or negative, like streaks or lines caused by cosmic-rays, diffraction spikes and cross-talk.\n",
    "  - **Brightness:** Negative flux (black pixels) at the center of the cutout in either the new or reference image. The source at the center can never be negative in the New or Reference image, only in the Differnece.\n",
    "  - **Misalignment:** If the source in the New and Reference images is misaligned, it will show a Yin-Yang pattern (both white and black) in the Difference image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Additional Guidance** \n",
    "- **Contextual Information:** Focus on the source at the center of the cutouts inside the red circle, but consider nearby sources to diagnose potential problems.  \n",
    "- **Examples:** Refer to provided visual examples of real and bogus sources to aid in identification. \n",
    "- **Judgment Criteria:** For ambiguous cases or borderline scenarios, consider the overall context and consistency with known characteristics of real and bogus sources.\n",

    "</INSTRUCTIONS>\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "METHOD = \"\"\"<METHOD>\n",
    "1. **Focus on the Red Circle**: Start by examining the source located at the center of the cutout and inside the red circle. The images are prepared so that the source of interest is clearly marked for you to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Each Image Individually**:\n",
    "   - **New Image**: Check for the presence, shape, and brightness of the source in the new image.\n",
    "   - **Reference Image**: Compare the source's properties in the reference image to those in the new image.\n",
    "   - **Difference Image**: Observe the residuals that result from subtracting the reference image from the new image. Look for patterns (circular, positive/negative flux) that match characteristics of Real or Bogus sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Features**:\n",
    "   - Examine the shape, brightness, and other relevant features (e.g., artifacts, misalignments) of the source in each image.\n",
    "   - Determine if these features are consistent with a Real or Bogus classification based on the criteria provided in the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consider Relationships Between Images**:\n",
    "   - Compare the new, reference, and difference images to understand any changes in the source over time.\n",
    "   - Look for discrepancies or confirmations that might support or contradict a particular classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Employ a Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**:\n",
    "   - Clearly outline each observation you make and explain how it contributes to your decision-making process.\n",
    "   - If you find any contradictions or ambiguous features, acknowledge them and provide reasoning for your final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assign an Interest Score**:\n",
    "   - After determining if the source is Real or Bogus, assign an appropriate interest score:\n",
    "     - 'No interest' for Bogus sources.\n",
    "     - 'Low interest' for variable transients.\n",
    "     - 'High interest' for explosive transients.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Prepare the Final Output in JSON Format**:\n",
    "   - Format your response as a JSON object containing:\n",
    "     - The classification ('Real' or 'Bogus').\n",
    "     - An explanation detailing your thought process and observations.\n",
    "     - The assigned interest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Example Output**:\n",
    "   - Refer to the provided examples to see the expected format and detail level of your response.\n",
